    "For this question, I calculated the total 6-year quantity sold for each drug group. I found that the \"N02BE\" drug group is the highest-selling drug group by a lot, with 49.4% of total drug groups sold over a 6-year period. I also created a pie chart as a data visualization to represent my calculations.\n",

    "For this question, I calculated the total quantity sold for each drug group for every year. I also created line graphs as a data visualization to represent my calculations. Again, we see the \"N02BE\" drug group has the most selling quantity in every year and this finding is similar to the question above. The main finding for this question is that no drug group had a stable selling trend in the 6-year period. Each one of them had its ups and downs."
